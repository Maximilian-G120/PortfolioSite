A hard-working, honest, young professional seeking part-time work to keep busy through the school year and make enough cash to pay for gas, school expenses and the occasional dinner with my girlfriend. You can put your trust in me to be courteous and respectful of others, trustworthy with your property and money and always represent you and your organization in the highest regard.
